My RPubs
========

This repository will store my articles that will be posted to the [RPubs](http://rpubs.com).

I have lost some my ad hoc analysises.  Sometimes, I want to see these analysises,
but, at the time, I can not find them.

Thus, I store the ad hoc analysises to this repository.  This may save me in the future.
